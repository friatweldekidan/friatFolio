        My Journey
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-gray-600 font-sans">
        Hi there! <span className="italic font-medium">I'm Friat, </span>a
        passionate developer on a journey that began in 2022. What started as a
        quest for more time and financial freedom to be with my daughter evolved
        into a profound love for coding and building digital solutions. Coming
        from a background in electromechanical engineering, I never imagined
        myself diving into lines of code, but hey, life is full of surprises!
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2 text-gray-600 font-sans">
        I've embraced the challenges and joys of software development. One of
        the things I cherish most about this journey is the opportunity to work
        within a team. Collaborating with like-minded individuals, sharing
        knowledge, and collectively solving problems energizes me and drives me
        to excel.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2 text-gray-600 font-sans">
        My journey into development has led me to have the skill of full stack
        MERN web development, but for now, I specialize in front-end
        development. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me spending quality
        time with my daughter. I believe that life is about balance. I'm excited
        about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my journey as a
        developer, and I look forward to continuing to grow, learn, and
        contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
